# Queuing System in JavaScript

This project showcases the implementation of a queuing system using Redis and JavaScript. The system is designed to handle various operations such as publishing, subscribing, and processing jobs in a queue. The project demonstrates the use of Redis for managing data and executing asynchronous operations effectively.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- **0-redis_client.js**: Establishes a basic connection to the Redis server.
- **1-redis_op.js**: Performs basic Redis operations like `set`, `get`, and `del`.
- **2-redis_op_async.js**: Implements asynchronous Redis operations.
- **4-redis_advanced_op.js**: Demonstrates advanced Redis operations.
- **5-publisher.js**: Publishes messages to Redis channels.
- **5-subscriber.js**: Subscribes to Redis channels and handles incoming messages.
- **6-job_creator.js**: Creates jobs and adds them to a Redis queue.
- **6-job_processor.js**: Processes jobs from the Redis queue.
- **7-job_creator.js**: An alternative script for job creation.
- **7-job_processor.js**: An alternative script for job processing.
- **8-job.js**: Manages job creation and lifecycle.
- **8-job.test.js**: Contains tests for job management.
- **9-stock.js**: Handles stock management operations.
- **100-seat.js**: Manages seat-related operations.
- **dump.rdb**: Redis database dump file containing data.
- **package.json**: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
- **babel.config.js**: Configuration file for Babel to transpile JavaScript.
- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **yarn.lock**: Lock file for Yarn dependency management.

## Installation
